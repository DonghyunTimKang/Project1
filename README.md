### Descriptiion/Rules

-This is a game called Cards Against HUmanity.
-When the black card on top is  clicked, a black card is drawn and it has a fill in the blank statement or question.
-4 players will get a stack of white cards and choose one card from their hand
to fill in the statement or answer the question. In order for the player to see
their hand, when it is their turn, you click your player deck and your hand will
be chosen.
-A judge will alternate each round, so the judge will be player one at round one,
player two at round two, player three at round three and so on.
-The judge will choose which card has the funniest card out of the three players
who chose a white card for that round. 
-A point will be added to the bottom of the players win tally. The first one to 
five wins will end the game. Because this game physically has no end, you will have
a choice to continue or end the game when the win condition is met.

### Techonologies/Design

-This game uses the clever use of buttons and jQuery's show and hide function.
-All pieces all exist already within the HTML. 
-Only when certainn conditions are met will the buttons reveal themselves.
-When the conditions change, new buttons will appear disappear, only to be shown
again in the next round of conditions

### Upcoming features/missed features

-So far this only supports one blank space rather than the game sometimes having draw
two or draw three. This will be added in the future.
-There are no fancy graphics quite yet due to the amount of time it took to
get this far. Also will be added later.
-4+ players will be supported as well in the future.
